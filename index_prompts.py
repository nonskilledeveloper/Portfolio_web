# My portfolio

Hello [enterprise_name]! 

I'm Carlos and this is my portfolio, if everything 
is running as it's supposed to, you should be 
receiving this website from a RaspBerry Pi server 
in my house ðŸ˜„

![IMG_3075](assets/IMG_3075.jpeg)

Is it not great? 
Well, I've always liked these things

If this is not the case, because we are having a 
storm, or because someone accidentally spilled a 
drop of antimatter over it, then you will receive 
the website from a mirrroring server.

In any case you will know it in the following label:

`Home-Server: [homeserver_status]`

For this, I had to configure not only the operating
system and software in the RaspBerry, but also my
home network to share these resources to the public.

Languages, tools and other knowledge needed for this
project:

* Python
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Svelte Framework (Still working with it)
* Linux
* Networks
* A weird humor sense

I learned most of these knowledges since my childhood, 
you can read a little more about my history in the 
"About me" section of my website, or typing the 
command "whoami"
